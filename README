WHAT IS IT?  Provides an Insert mode completion function which completes names
from a .glade file as produced by the Glade UI designer.
http://glade.gnome.org/

HOW DOES IT WORK?  The plugin defines a function which scans .glade files in
current buffer's current directory.  The function adds Gtk objects and event
handlers to the insert mode completion menu

The menu is invoked by pressing <C-x><C-u> in insert mode.  Read all about it
at |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U|.

Each time the completion function is invoked, it looks at the .glade files in
the current directory and compares the filesystem's modification timestamp
with the timestamp value from the previous invocation.  Thus, if you
add/change a widget in Glade and save the file, those changes are reflected
immediately in Vim.
